# Network_attack_classification
This repository gives the detailed process of detecting and classifying network attacks using the NSL KDD data.

Attacks are often preceded by pre-intrusion activities such as port scanning and IP spoofing. These activities can be identified by analyzing features from source and destination IP addresses, ports, protocol details, and header information. Our goal is to develop an effective model that can accurately identify a network attack and a separate model to classify types of attacks. Specifically in our project we explored the overall process from processing datasets, augmenting datasets, modeling and evaluating ML models for attack detection, to developing an additional model that can classify the types of attacks.
